# Waterdrop Fil+ DataCap Allocator - Client Application

Welcome to the GitHub code repository dedicated to managing lifecycle data symbol (LDN) applications for specific Waterdrop Fil+ DataCap allocator teams. This code base serves as a common ledger for DataCap allocation requests and tracking, enhancing the transparency and efficiency of the process.

## Overview

Filecoin Plus (Fil+) not only stores data but also verifies the practicality of the stored data, thereby enhancing the practicality of Filecoin. DataCap allocates to customers based on their storage requirements and the value their data brings to the Filecoin network. Our team uses a shared multi-signature wallet to act as a distributor for DataCap, evaluating and verifying customer requests.

Working principle

This GitHub codebase is not a traditional codebase but serves as a structured ledger that processes DataCap requests through client applications. The lifecycle of each application (from request to allocation) is publicly recorded here.

Apply for DataCap

1. ** Submit Issue** : Customers who wish to apply for DataCap must submit a new Issue in this codebase. The Issue should contain detailed information about the project that requires a DataCap. Basic information includes but is not limited to:
- Project name and description
The number of datacaps applied for
The reason for the number of datacaps
- KYC number applicant information

2. ** Fill in the application template ** : The Issue template will guide customers to submit the information required for the DataCap application.

Review and allocation process

1. ** Preliminary Review ** : After the Issue is submitted, our allocation team will conduct a preliminary review to ensure that all necessary information has been provided.
2. ** Discussion and Clarification ** : The team may discuss in the Issue discussion thread to clarify or obtain more information.
3. ** Decision ** : The allocation team will make a decision on the DataCap application. If the application is approved, the process will enter the allocation stage.

Manage the client application lifecycle

The lifecycle of each client application is tracked through the '.json 'file in this repository, which is uniquely associated with the client's issues.
The '.json 'file is created when the application first receives allocation approval and is updated through pull requests as more datacaps are allocated or as the application state changes.
This structured approach ensures transparency and traceability for both the client side and the allocation team.

Code of Conduct

This repository adheres to a code of conduct to ensure a respectful and efficient environment for all participants. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
