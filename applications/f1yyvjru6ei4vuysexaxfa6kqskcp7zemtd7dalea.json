    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The 1000 Genomes Project is an international collaboration which has established the most detailed catalogue of human genetic variation, including SNPs, structural variants, and their haplotype context. The final phase of the project sequenced more than 2500 individuals from 26 different populations around the world and produced an integrated set of phased haplotypes with more than 80 million variants for these individuals.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",

    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We downloaded the data from https://registry.opendata.aws/1000-genomes/, classified the content, and then used the built-in tools officially provided by Lotus (Filecoin's reference implementation) to split, compress, and package the data, and finally distributed it to SPs.",

    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "2 to 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Asia other than Greater China, Europe, North America, South America",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
