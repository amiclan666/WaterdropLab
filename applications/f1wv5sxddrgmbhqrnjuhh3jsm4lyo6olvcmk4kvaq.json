    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Our team is Revelation Technology Co., Ltd., located in Hong Kong. We provide technical support for data processing, data storage, data repair, etc. to our customers.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The Sentinel-1 (SLC) dataset contains SAR data at C-band wavelengths. The SAR sensor is installed on the dual-satellite constellation (Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B) operated by the European Space Agency, which orbits the Earth and has a total revisit time of six days. S1 SLC data belongs to Level-1 products and can collect radar amplitude and phase information under all-weather, daytime or nighttime conditions. It is highly suitable for studying natural disasters and emergency response, land-based applications, oil spill monitoring, sea ice conditions, and related climate change impacts.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We used the Go language to develop a set of tools that automatically download, cut, package data, and place orders. The tool will download the data set file from AWS, package the data set into a car file of the corresponding size by setting parameters such as sector size, and then distribute the car file to each SP through bandwidth and hard disk mail. Then, we use Boost to issue orders offline to let the SP start packaging using the Boost.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://sentinel1-slc-seasia-pds/ 592.5488 TiB",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "2 to 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, North America, South America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03289271 Germany\nf03315260 Germany\nf03367915 United States\nf03542777 Vietnam\nf03559187 United States\nf03607310 Brazil\nf03100006 HongKong\nf03100007 HongKong",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
