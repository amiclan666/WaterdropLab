    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Revelation Limited is a technology company based in Hong Kong. We are mainly in the blockchain business. Business covers Bitcoin, ETH, Filecoin, Chia, spacemech, livepeer, io.net, subspace, etc. There are rich development and server operation and maintenance operations. We are also one of Fielcoin's storage providers.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS_LIVE) project has a singular mission: to accelerate ice sheet and glacier research by producing globally comprehensive, high resolution, low latency, temporally dense, multi-sensor records of land ice and ice shelf change while minimizing barriers between the data and the user. ITS_LIVE data currently consists of NetCDF Level 2 scene-pair ice flow products posted to a standard 120 m grid derived from Landsat 4/5/7/8/9, Sentinel-2 optical scenes, and Sentinel-1 SAR scenes. We have processed all land-ice intersecting image pairs separated by ≤546 days for optical and ≤12 for SAR sensors, for all missions from each mission start to the end of 2022. The ITS_LIVE project will continue processing new optical and radar scene pairs as they come in, and will soon increase production to include SAR image pairs separated by more than 12 days. We also expect to extend processing to include ASTER, RADARSAT, and NISAR imagery. Further, all scene pair data are combined into a set of Zarr datacubes that are cloud-optimized for time-series analysis, with a suite of user tools available to query the data effectively. The ITS_LIVE project is also producing a suite of Level 3 products, including quarterly and annual ice-sheet and regional velocity mosaics as Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs, standardized records of elevation change rates for Greenland and Antarctica, and ice shelf and tidewater glacier front positions. For more information about the ITS_LIVE project, please see https://its-live.jpl.nasa.gov/.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We used the Go language to develop a set of tools that automatically download, cut, package data, and place orders. The tool will download the data set file from AWS, package the data set into a car file of the corresponding size by setting parameters such as sector size, and then distribute the car file to each SP through bandwidth and hard disk mail. Then, we use Boost to issue orders offline to let the SP start packaging using the Lotus program.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://registry.opendata.aws/its-live-data/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "North America, Europe, Asia other than Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03289271 Germany\nf03315260 Germany\nf03367915 United States\nf03368008 Vietnam\nf03542777 Vietnam\nf03603117 United States\nf03559187 United States",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
